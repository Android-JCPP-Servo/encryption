# Encryption
BYU-Idaho CSE 453 - W13 LAB: ENCRYPTION

## Instructions
This lab will be completed individually. The purpose of this assignment is to learn the mechanics of creating a real cipher. It is one thing to understand the theory of a cipher and to be able to execute the algorithm by hand; it is another thing entirely to write code to do the same. Complete the following steps, then create a short video to demonstrate your program.
1. Choose a cipher algorithm you would like to learn more about. Research it, then write pseudocode for the encrypt and decrypt functions.
2. Implement a function to encrypt the plaintext.
3. Implement a function to decrypt the ciphertext.
